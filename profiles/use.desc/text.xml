<title>Profiles <c>use.desc</c> and <c>use.local.desc</c> Files</title>
<body>

<p>
The <c>use.desc</c> file contains a list of all global non-expanded <c>USE</c> flags,
together with a short description. This file should not be modified without
discussion on the <c>gentoo-dev</c> list.
</p>

<p>
The <c>use.local.desc</c> file contains a list of all local <c>USE</c> flags, together
with the relevant packages, and a short description. This file can be added to
without general discussion.
</p>

<p>
Having a small number of packages using identically named local <c>USE</c> flags is
allowed. If the number starts to grow substantially, it may be worth proposing
that the flag becomes a global <d /> see
<uri link="::general-concepts/use-flags#Local and Global USE Flags"/>.
</p>

<p>
All non-expand flags must be listed in exactly one of these files.
</p>

<p>Expanded flags are listed in <c>desc/${prefix}.desc</c>, where <c>${prefix}</c> is the
name of the environment variable to be expanded in lowercase. Instead of listing the
complete flag only the flag's suffix, i.e. the environment variable's possible values are
listed.</p>
