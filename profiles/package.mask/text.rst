Profiles ``package.mask`` File
==============================

The ``package.mask`` file can be used to hard mask packages or certain versions
of packages. This is often used when adding certain experimental (either in
ebuild or upstream terms) packages to the tree. The format is described in
`portage-5`_.

This file can be used in subprofiles to mask packages only for certain setups.
