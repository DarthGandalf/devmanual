Profiles ``packages`` File
==========================

The ``packages`` file in ``profiles/`` controls the packages pulled in by the
``system`` target. The ``base/packages`` file must not be modified without
discussion on the ``gentoo-dev`` list; subprofile overrides are up to the
relevant arch teams.
