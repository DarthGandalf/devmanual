Arch Specific Notes
===================

This section provides a brief overview of various arch-specific issues. It is not
complete, and it is not a substitute for discussing any problems with the
relevant arch team.

.. Note:: People who have worked with some other distributions may find Gentoo's
  views on architecture support slightly unfamiliar. We do not follow Debian's
  attempts to provide a standard set of packages at specific versions and install
  it onto every platform -- rather, we simply attempt to provide whatever
  happens to work best in any situation.
