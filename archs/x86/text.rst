Arch Specific Notes -- x86
==========================

Originally, it was assumed that all developers would have access to x86 hardware
and that x86 would be maintained by everyone. For this reason there is no team
for x86 of the kind that exists for other archs -- there *is* an ``x86@``
Bugzilla alias, but it is generally only used for security bugs where the herd
has no members with x86 hardware.
