<title>Removing ebuilds</title>
<body>

<p>
When removing an ebuild make sure that no dependencies in Portage are broken
due to the removal <d/> additionally, your git commit message should explain
clearly why the ebuild is being removed from the git repository.
</p>

<p>
If you need to remove ebuilds, make sure you do not accidentally remove
the newest/only stable ebuild for any architecture. If you would like to
get a newer version marked stable, then please file a bug or ask on IRC.
</p>

<p>
You should also not cause an unnecessary downgrade for any "<c>~arch</c>"
when removing ebuilds <d/> instead, it is best to get the newest version
marked "<c>~arch</c>" first and then remove redundant versions of the ebuild.

<title>Removing a package</title>
<body>

<p>
When removing packages follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Make sure that no dependencies in the Gentoo repository are broken due to
    the removal
  </li>
  <li>Send last rites to gentoo-dev-announce and gentoo-dev</li>
  <li>Mask the package</li>
  <li>Wait 30 days (or more)</li>
  <li>Remove from the git tree unless the reason for removal has been fixed</li>
  <li>
    Remove any references to the package from other ebuilds, e.g.,
    use-conditional dependencies. Blockers are the only exception to this.
  </li>
  <li>Remove package.mask and any package.use.mask entries</li>
  <li>
    Remove the <c>&lt;pkg&gt;</c> tags referencing this package in the
    <uri link="::ebuild-writing/misc-files/metadata">metadata.xml</uri>
    files of other packages.
  </li>
  <li>Close open bugs as WONTFIX</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here is a list of commands that will delete <c>dev-util/pmk</c>
from the tree:
</p>

<pre>
# cd dev-qt
# git rm -rf qtphonon
# git commit --gpg-sign
</pre>
