<title>Eclass Writing Guide</title>

<body>
<p>
This section provides a brief introduction to eclass authoring.
</p>

<important>
You should reread the <uri link="::general-concepts/overlay#Overlay and Eclasses"/>
and <uri link="::general-concepts/portage-cache"/> sections before continuing.
</important>

<section>
<title>Purpose of Eclasses</title>
<body>

<p>
An eclass is a collection of code which can be used by more than one ebuild. At
the time of writing, all eclasses live in the <c>eclass/</c> directory in the tree.
Roughly speaking, there are three kinds of eclass:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Those which provide common functions which are used by many ebuilds (for
    example, <c>eutils</c>, <c>versionator</c>, <c>cvs</c>, <c>bash-completion</c>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Those which provide a basic build system for many similar packages (for
    example, <c>vim-plugin</c>, <c>kde</c>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Those which handle one or a small number of packages with complex build
    systems (for example, <c>vim</c>, <c>toolchain</c>, <c>kernel-2</c>)
  </li>
</ul>

<section>
<title>Adding and Updating Eclasses</title>
<body>

<p>
Before committing a new eclass to the tree, it should be emailed to the
gentoo-dev mailing list with a justification and a proposed implementation. Do
not skip this step <d/> sometimes a better implementation or an alternative which
does not require a new eclass will be suggested.
</p>

<p>
Before updating <c>eutils</c> or a similar widely used eclass, it is best to email
the gentoo-dev list. It may be that your proposed change is broken in a way you
had not anticipated, or that there is an existing function which performs the
same purpose, or that your function may be better off in its own eclass. If you
don't email gentoo-dev first, and end up breaking something, expect to be in a
lot of trouble.
</p>

<p>
When removing a function or changing the API of an eclass, make
sure that it doesn't break any ebuilds in the tree, and post a
notice to gentoo-dev at least 30 days in advance, preferably with
a patch included.
</p>

<p>
If there is an existing maintainer for an eclass (this is usually the case), you
<b>must</b> talk to the maintainer before committing any changes.
</p>

<p>
It is not usually necessary to email the gentoo-dev list before making changes
to a non-general eclass which you maintain. Use common sense here.
</p>

<warning>
Committing a broken eclass can kill huge numbers of packages. Since
<c>repoman</c> is not eclass-aware, be very sure you do proper testing.
</warning>

<p>
A simple way to verify syntax is <c>bash -n foo.eclass</c>.

<title>Removing Eclasses</title>
<body>

<p>No longer used eclasses may be removed from the tree, but developers must
adhere to the following process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Make sure that no packages or other eclasses in the tree <c>inherit</c> the
    eclass.
  </li>
  <li>
    Send a lastrite message to the gentoo-dev and gentoo-dev-announce
    mailing-lists, announcing that the not-used eclass will be removed in 30
    days.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add a one line comment to the eclass, saying exactly <c># @DEAD</c> so that
    the eclass-manpages package will not attempt to document it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Wait for the 30-day period to pass, then remove the eclass from the tree.
  </li>
</ol>


</body>

<section>
<title>Documenting Eclasses</title>
<body>

<p>
Eclasses are documented as any other bash project is, with code
comments. We do however have a standard format for eclass, variable,
and function headers. The <c>app-portage/eclass-manpages</c> package
processes these headers to create documentation for the eclass. The
result can be seen in our <uri link="::eclass-reference/">eclass
reference</uri>, or by installing <c>app-portage/eclass-manpages</c>.
</p>
<p>
The format for eclass, variable, and function headers are described
below. Before committing your eclass, please ensure that the
<c>eclass-to-manpage.sh</c> script (currently in <c>$FILESDIR</c> for
<c>app-portage/eclass-manpages</c> in the <c>gentoo.git</c> repo) does
not report any errors or serious warnings for your eclass.
</p>
</body>
</section>


<section>
<title>Basic Eclass Format</title>
<body>

<p>
An eclass is a <c>bash</c> script which is sourced within the ebuild environment.
Files should be a simple text file with a <c>.eclass</c> extension. Allowed
characters in the filename are lowercase letters, the digits 0-9, hyphens,
underscores and dots. Eclasses are not intrinsically versioned.
</p>

<p>
Eclasses should start with the standard ebuild header, along with
comments explaining the maintainer and purpose of the eclass, and any
other relevant documentation. The format supported by
<c>app-portage/eclass-manpages</c> is as follows:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
# @ECLASS: foo.eclass
# @MAINTAINER:
# &lt;required; list of contacts, one per line&gt;
# @AUTHOR:
# &lt;optional; list of authors, one per line&gt;
# @BUGREPORTS:
# &lt;optional; description of how to report bugs;
#  default: tell people to use bugs.gentoo.org&gt;
# @VCSURL: &lt;optional; url to vcs for this eclass; default: https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/log/eclass/@ECLASS@&gt;
# @BLURB: &lt;required; short description&gt;
# @DESCRIPTION:
# &lt;optional; long description&gt;
# @EXAMPLE:
# &lt;optional; example usage&gt;
</codesample>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Eclass Variables</title>
<body>

<p>
Top level variables may be defined as for ebuilds. If any USE flags are
used, <c>IUSE</c> must be set. The <c>KEYWORDS</c> variable must <b>not</b> be set in an
eclass.
</p>
<p>
You should document the meaning, usage, and default value of every
variable in your eclass. The standard format supported by
<c>app-portage/eclass-manpages</c> is,
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: foo
# [@DEFAULT_UNSET]
# [@INTERNAL]
# [@REQUIRED]
# @DESCRIPTION:
# &lt;required; blurb about this variable&gt;
# foo=&quot;&lt;default value&gt;&quot;
</codesample>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Eclass Functions</title>
<body>

<p>
Eclasses may define functions. These functions will be visible to anything which
inherits the eclass.
</p>
<p>
You should document the purpose, arguments, usage, and return value of
every function in your eclass. The standard format supported by
<c>app-portage/eclass-manpages</c> is,
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
# @FUNCTION: foo
# @USAGE: &lt;required arguments to foo&gt; [optional arguments to foo]
# @RETURN: &lt;whatever foo returns&gt;
# @MAINTAINER:
# &lt;optional; list of contacts, one per line&gt;
# [@INTERNAL]
# @DESCRIPTION:
# &lt;required if no @RETURN; blurb about this function&gt;
</codesample>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Simple Common Functions Eclass Example</title>
<body>

<p>
As an example, the following eclass was written to illustrate a better way of
installing OSX application files during a discussion on this subject. It defines
a single function, <c>domacosapp</c>.
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
# Copyright 1999-2016 Gentoo Foundation
# Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2
# &#36;Id&#36;

#
# Original Author: Ciaran McCreesh &lt;ciaranm@gentoo.org&gt;
# Purpose: install macos .app files to the relevant location.
#
# Bugs to osx@gentoo.org
#

# domacosapp: install a macos .app file. Usage is 'domacosapp file' or
# 'domacosapp file newfile'.

domacosapp() {
    [[ -z "${1}" ]] &amp;&amp; die "usage: domacosapp &lt;file&gt; &lt;new file&gt;"
    if use ppc-macos ; then
        insinto /Applications
        newins "$1" "${2:-${1}}" || die "Failed to install ${1}"
    fi
}
</codesample>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Export Functions</title>
<body>

<p>
An eclass may provide default implementations for any of the standard ebuild
functions (<c>src_unpack</c>, <c>pkg_postinst</c> etc). This can be done either as a
simple function definition (which is not multiple eclass friendly) or using
<c>EXPORT_FUNCTIONS</c>. Functions given to <c>EXPORT_FUNCTIONS</c> are implemented
as normal, but have their name prefixed with <c>${ECLASS}_</c>.
</p>

<important>
Only 'standard' functions should be specified in <c>EXPORT_FUNCTIONS</c>.
</important>

<note><c>EXPORT_FUNCTIONS</c> is a function, <e>not</e> a variable.</note>

<p>
If multiple eclasses export the same function, the latest (inherited last)
defined version wins.  If an ebuild defines a function that is exported, this
gets priority over any eclass version. This can be used to override
eclass-defined defaults <d/> for example, say we had <c>fnord.eclass</c>:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
EXPORT_FUNCTIONS src_compile

fnord_src_compile() {
    do_stuff || die
}
</codesample>

<p>
Then an ebuild could do this:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
inherit fnord.eclass

src_compile() {
    do_pre_stuff || die
    fnord_src_compile
    do_post_stuff || die
}
</codesample>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Simple Build System Eclass Example</title>
<body>

<p>
A simple eclass which defines a number of functions and a default
<c>src_compile</c> for the (hypothetical) <c>jmake</c> build system might look
something like the following:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
# Copyright 1999-2016 Gentoo Foundation
# Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2
# &#36;Id&#36;

# Original Author: Ciaran McCreesh &lt;ciaranm@gentoo.org&gt;
# Purpose: Demonstration of EXPORT_FUNCTIONS. Defines simple wrappers for the
# (hypothetical) 'jmake' build system and a default src_compile.

EXPORT_FUNCTIONS src_compile

DEPEND="&gt;=sys-devel/jmake-2"

jmake-configure() {
    jmake configure --prefix=/usr "$@"
}

jmake-build() {
    jmake dep &amp;&amp; jmake build "$@"
}

jmake_src_compile() {
    jmake-configure || die "configure failed"
    jmake-build || die "build failed"
}
</codesample>

</body>

<section>
<title>Handling incorrect usage of an eclass</title>
<body>

<p>
Sometimes an eclass is used incorrectly by an ebuild and the eclass
knows it is being used incorrectly- the common example is an
eclass that only works with a specific set of EAPIs, but is being
accessed inherited by an ebuild with a different EAPI.
In those cases, used sparingly as a last resort, it is allowed
for an eclass to invoke die from the global scope.  For example:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
# Copyright 1999-2016 Gentoo Foundation
# Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2
# &#36;Id&#36;

# Purpose: Demonstration of die upon invalid EAPI usage.

case ${EAPI:-0} in
  0) die "this eclass doesn't support EAPI 0" ;;
  *) ;;
esac
