  <para>
    All ebuilds must specify a <varname>LICENSE</varname> (note the American English spelling) variable. The value of
    this variable must be the name of a file in the Portage tree's <filename>licenses/</filename> directory.
  </para>

  <para>

    <title>Adding New Licenses</title>

    <para>
      If your package's license is not already in the tree, you must add the license before committing the package. When
      adding the license, use a plain text file if at all possible. Some licenses are PDF files rather than plain text â€”
      this should only be done if we are legally required to do so.
    </para>

    <para>
      It is not normally necessary to mail the <email>gentoo-dev@lists.gentoo.org</email> list before adding a new
      license. You should only do so if the license could be considered 'questionable' or if you are unsure as to the
      meaning of any part of it.
