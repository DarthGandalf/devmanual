  <title><filename>Manifest</filename></title>

  <para>
    In the tree, every package has a <filename>Manifest</filename> file. This file lives in the same directory as the
    ebuilds for the package. The <filename>Manifest</filename> file contains digests (currently MD5, RMD160 and SHA256)
    and file size data for every file in the directory and any subdirectories. This is used to verify integrity. The
    <filename>Manifest</filename> may also be digitally signed.
  </para>

  <para>
    To generate the <filename>Manifest</filename>, use <command>ebuild foo.ebuild manifest</command>. When committing,
    the <filename>Manifest</filename> file must be regenerated to handle any CVS keyword expansion changes â€”
    <command>repoman</command> will do this automatically.
