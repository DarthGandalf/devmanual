  <para>
    During the <function>src_unpack</function>, <function>src_compile</function>, <function>src_test</function> and
    <function>src_install</function> phases, <filename>ebuild.sh</filename> operates inside a
    <emphasis>sandbox</emphasis>. This is a special environment which attempts to help prevent badly written ebuilds (or
    ebuilds working with badly written build systems) accidentally writing outside of permitted locations.
  </para>

  <para>
    <emphasis>All packages must build correctly when sandbox is active.</emphasis> Packages must not achieve this by
    using sneaky tricks to make sandbox warnings not show up â€” the sandbox is there to ensure that binary packages will
    work correctly, and that a badly written <filename>Makefile</filename> won't cause problems. Using
    <command>addwrite</command> is generally <emphasis>not</emphasis> the correct solution.
