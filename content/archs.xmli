<title>Arch Specific Notes</title>


<para>
This section provides a brief overview of various arch-specific issues. It is not
complete, and it is not a substitute for discussing any problems with the
relevant arch team.

<note><para>
People who have worked with some other distributions may find Gentoo's
views on architecture support slightly unfamiliar. We do not follow Debian's
attempts to provide a standard set of packages at specific versions and install
it onto every platform â€” rather, we simply attempt to provide whatever
happens to work best in any situation.
