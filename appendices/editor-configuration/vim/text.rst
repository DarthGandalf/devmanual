Configuring ``vim`` and ``gvim``
================================

For full whitespace, character set, syntax and indent settings for ``vim`` and ``gvim``, emerge the ``app-vim/gentoo-syntax`` package.

When fixing ebuilds with broken whitespace, the ``:retab!`` command may be of interest. The ! is required to replace spaces with tabs.
