Herds and Projects
==================

A *herd* is a collection of developers who maintain a collection of related
packages. A herd has an associated email address which can be used for bugzilla
assignments. This email address is **not** always ``herdname@gentoo.org`` -- for
example, because of the way Gentoo's email aliases are set up, the ``cron`` herd
use ``cron-bugs@gentoo.org`` (aliases cannot match system usernames).

A *project* is a group formed for handling a particular general area. A project
may have herds associated with it.

Sometimes herd and project names overlap -- for example, the ``sparc`` project
has an associated ``sparc`` herd which maintains sparc-specific packages (such
as the ``silo`` bootloader). This is *not* always the case.

The ``herdstat`` tool can display useful information about herds.
