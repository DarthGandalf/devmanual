<title>Herds and Projects</title>

<body>

<p>
A <i>herd</i> is a collection of developers who maintain a collection of related
packages. A herd has an associated email address which can be used for bugzilla
assignments. This email address is <b>not</b> always <c>herdname@gentoo.org</c> -- for
example, because of the way Gentoo's email aliases are set up, the <c>cron</c> herd
use <c>cron-bugs@gentoo.org</c> (aliases cannot match system usernames).
</p>

<p>
A <i>project</i> is a group formed for handling a particular general area. A project
may have herds associated with it.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes herd and project names overlap -- for example, the <c>sparc</c> project
has an associated <c>sparc</c> herd which maintains sparc-specific packages (such
as the <c>silo</c> bootloader). This is <i>not</i> always the case.
</p>

<p>
The <c>herdstat</c> tool can display useful information about herds.
