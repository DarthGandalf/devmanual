<title>Slotting</title>

<body>
<p>
Packages can support having multiple versions installed simultaneously. This is
useful for libraries which may have changed interfaces between versions -- for
example, the <c>gtk+</c> package can install both versions <c>1.2</c> and <c>2.6</c> in
parallel. This feature is called slotting.
</p>

<p>
Most packages have no need for slotting. These packages specify <c>SLOT="0"</c> in
the ebuilds. This is <b>not</b> the same as specifying an empty slot -- an empty
slot means &quot;disable slotting entirely&quot;, and should not be used.
</p>

<p>
Portage permits at most one instance of a package installation <e>per <c>SLOT</c>
value</e>.  For example, say we have the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><c>foo-1.1</c> with <c>SLOT="1"</c></li>
  <li><c>foo-1.2</c> with <c>SLOT="1"</c></li>
  <li><c>foo-2.0</c> with <c>SLOT="2"</c></li>
  <li><c>foo-2.1</c> with <c>SLOT="2"</c></li>
</ul>

<p>
Then the user could have, say, <c>foo-1.2</c> and <c>foo-2.0</c> installed in
parallel, but <e>not</e> <c>foo-1.1</c> and <c>foo-1.2</c>. Note that it is entirely
possible that the user may have <c>foo-2.0</c> installed and no <c>foo-1.x</c> at all.
</p>

<p>
It is not possible to <c>DEPEND</c> upon a package in a specific slot.
</p>

<p>
Currently portage will accept an arbitrary string for the value of <c>SLOT</c>. For
future compatibility, it is recommended that slots contain only characters which
are allowed in an ebuild name or version (alphanumerics, hypens, full stops,
underscores, the plus character) -- other characters may cause problems with
future portage enhancements.
