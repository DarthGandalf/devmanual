<title>Digest and Manifest</title>

<body>
<p>
In the tree, every package has a <c>Manifest</c> file. This file lives in the same
directory as the ebuilds for the package. The <c>Manifest</c> file contains digests
(currently MD5) and file size data for every file in the directory and any
subdirectories. This is used to verify integrity.
</p>

<p>
The <c>Manifest</c> may be digitally signed.
</p>

<p>
Inside the <c>files/</c> subdirectory, there is exactly one <c>digest</c> file per
ebuild. Each file contains a digest (currently MD5) and a file size for every
file listed in <c>SRC_URI</c> for the ebuild. This is used to verify downloads and
to catch any changed source files.
</p>

<p>
When generating digests, it is necessary to include <i>all</i> of the files which
<i>could</i> be downloaded (<c>SRC_URI</c> can contain conditional entries). Portage
will do this automatically if <c>cvs</c> is included in <c>FEATURES</c>.
</p>

<p>
To generate digests and <c>Manifest</c>, use <c>ebuild foo.ebuild digest</c>. When
committing, the <c>Manifest</c> file must be regenerated to handle any CVS keyword
expansion changes -- <c>repoman</c> will do this automatically.
