<title>Manifest</title>

<body>
<p>
In the tree, every package has a <c>Manifest</c> file. This file lives in the same
directory as the ebuilds for the package. The <c>Manifest</c> file contains digests
(currently RMD160, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512 and WHIRLPOOL) and file size data for every
file in the directory and any subdirectories. This is used to verify integrity.
The <c>Manifest</c> may also be digitally signed.
</p>

<p>
To generate the <c>Manifest</c>, use <c>ebuild foo.ebuild manifest</c>. When
committing, the <c>Manifest</c> file must be regenerated to handle any CVS keyword
expansion changes <d/> <c>repoman</c> will do this automatically.
