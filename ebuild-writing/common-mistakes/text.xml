<title>Common Mistakes</title>

<body>
<p>
This section contains information on the common mistakes developers make when
writing ebuilds.

<section>
<title>Invalid use of <c>static</c> use-flag</title>
<body>
The <c>static</c> use-flag should only be used to make a binary use static
linking instead of dynamic linking.  It should not be used to make a library
install static libraries.  The package should always (if possible) install both
the dynamic and static libraries.

<section>
<title>Referencing the full path to documentation files that could be
compressed</title>
<body>
When printing out to the users where to find files like INSTALL, do not specify
the full path since <c>PORTAGE_COMPRESS</c> comes into play.  The file could be
compressed with gzip, bzip2, or some other random compression tool.  So,
instead of doing this:

<codesample lang="ebuild">
elog "They are listed in /usr/share/doc/${PF}/INSTALL.gz"
</codesample>

Do something like:

<codesample lang="ebuild">
elog "They are listed in the INSTALL file in /usr/share/doc/${PF}"
</codesample>
